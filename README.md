# Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) Supply Chain Management ProjectðŸ“ˆâŒ›

# Company Overview
A Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company entered into the instant noodles business two years back. Identifying there is a mismatch in the demand and supply. Where it led to results in a loss in inventory cost and ultimately loss to the company. Hence, the higher management wants to optimize the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in the entire country.

# Data Overview
The dataset includes information about warehouses, managers, regional zones, and various factors affecting the supply chain.
Problem: Mismatch in demand and supply, resulting in inventory costs and losses.                    
Goal: Build a model using historical data to determine the optimum weight of the product shipped from each warehouse.

# Problem Solving Methods
1.Initial Dataset Exploration : It will explore raw dataset that has been imported.

2.Data Cleaning : Address missing values, drop unnecessary columns,filling missing values with the mean and prepare the data for analysis.

3.Data Preprocessing : Encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, and prepare the data for modeling.

4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : Understand the dataset, identify patterns, and gain insights into the business.

5.Correlation Analysis : Investigate the relationships between variables to understand their impact on the target variable.

6.Data Visualization : Create visualizations to understand the distribution, relationships, and trends in the data.

7.Feature Engineering : Enhance the dataset by creating new features or modifying existing ones.

8.Model Building : Implement multiple machine learning algorithms to predict the optimum product weight.

9.Model Evaluation : Assess the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared.

10.Model Comparison : Identify the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

# Next Step
Gathering more data : Expanding the dataset with additional relevant information.

Collaboration and Communication : It encourage knowledge sharing and alignment of goals to facilitate effective decision-making and execution.

Model interpretation : Understanding the model's decisions and adjusting accordingly.

Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation 

# Conclusion
The comprehensive analysis and modeling undertaken in this project have provided valuable insights into optimizing the supply quantity for the FMCG company's instant noodles business. Random Forest algorithm emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an impressively low Mean Squared Error. The visualizations and exploratory data analysis have enriched our understanding of the dataset, uncovering trends and relationships crucial for informed decision-making in the supply chain management process. The combination of data cleaning, feature engineering, and advanced modeling techniques has contributed to a robust solution for the company's supply chain optimization.
